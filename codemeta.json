	"description": "The FREYA project is building up human and technical resources to support persistent identifier (PID) infrastructure in the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). One important gap identified during the planning of the project is the lack of a central resource that allows for the discovery of relevant persistent identifier services by all relevant stakeholders. With this deliverable we are closing this gap by providing a PID Services Registry for the EOSC with initially 35 services described. 
  The PID Services Registry collects standardized information aligned with the EOSC Marketplace, and registers a persistent identifier (a DataCite DOI) with associated metadata for each service. The initial release describes the services provided by FREYA partners, but going forward all relevant PID services will be included, based on standard inclusion criteria and an editorial team from FREYA partners.
  The other focus of our work going forward is adoption by users, both infrastructure providers needing to integrate with the variety of PID services available today, as well as researchers and other end users.
  Service Registries for EOSC are a highly dynamic area that has changed since the beginning of the FREYA project.",
